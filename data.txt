Summary

Background A safe and efficacious vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), if
deployed with high coverage, could contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the safety and
efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in a pooled interim analysis of four trials.
Methods This analysis includes data from four ongoing blinded, randomised, controlled trials done across the UK,
Brazil, and South Africa. Participants aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19
vaccine or control (meningococcal group A, C, W, and Y conjugate vaccine or saline). Participants in the ChAdOx1
nCoV-19 group received two doses containing 5 × 10¹⁰ viral particles (standard dose; SD/SD cohort); a subset in the UK
trial received a half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose (LD/SD cohort). The
primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid
amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according
to treatment received, with data cutoff on Nov 4, 2020. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 − relative risk derived from
a robust Poisson regression model adjusted for age. Studies are registered at ISRCTN89951424 and ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT04324606, NCT04400838, and NCT04444674.
Findings Between April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23 848 participants were enrolled and 11 636 participants (7548 in the UK,
4088 in Brazil) were included in the interim primary efficacy analysis. In participants who received two standard
doses, vaccine efficacy was 62·1% (95% CI 41·0–75·7; 27 [0·6%] of 4440 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group vs 71 [1·6%]
of 4455 in the control group) and in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose, efficacy
was 90·0% (67·4–97·0; three [0·2%] of 1367 vs 30 [2·2%] of 1374; pinteraction=0·010). Overall vaccine efficacy across both
groups was 70·4% (95·8% CI 54·8–80·6; 30 [0·5%] of 5807 vs 101 [1·7%] of 5829). From 21 days after the first dose,
there were ten cases hospitalised for COVID-19, all in the control arm; two were classified as severe COVID-19,
including one death. There were 74 341 person-months of safety follow-up (median 3·4 months, IQR 1·3–4·8):
175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 91 in the control
group. Three events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, one in the
control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation.
Interpretation ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has an acceptable safety profile and has been found to be efficacious against
symptomatic COVID-19 in this interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for research articles published from
database inception until Nov 23, 2020, with no language
restrictions, using the terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “vaccine”, “clinical
trial”, and “efficacy”. There were no peer-reviewed publications
available on efficacy of any severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in development and,
at the time of the search, there were no licensed vaccines
against SARS-CoV-2. Three vaccine developers recently
reported initial efficacy results from phase 3 trials in the media
(Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and the Gamaleya National
Research Center). Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, both
developing mRNA vaccines, have reported initial efficacy
results of 95% in their primary analysis (Pfizer/BioNTech) and
94·5% in an interim analysis (Moderna). We have previously
published safety and immunogenicity results of ChAdOx1
nCoV-19 (AZD1222) for different age groups in phase 1/2 and
2/3 trials.

Introduction
As the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
continues to unfold, there has been widespread impact
on health, including substantial mortality among older
adults and those with pre-existing health conditions,1,2
and repercussions for the global economy, caused by
physical distancing measures, with the greatest conse­
quences for the most vulnerable in society.
Despite global spread of the virus, a large proportion
of the population in many countries is thought to have
thus far escaped infection and remains non-immune to
SARS-CoV-2.3 Vaccines could play an important role in
increasing population immunity, preventing severe
disease, and reducing the ongoing health crisis. In
response, rapid global efforts to develop and test vaccines
against SARS-CoV-2 have led to an unprecedented
number of candidate vaccines starting clinical trials
during 2020. Currently, 48 vaccines are under clinical
evaluation.4 Several of these have shown good safety and
immunogenicity, and 11 of these are currently being
evaluated in phase 3 clinical efficacy studies.
The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) was
developed at Oxford University and consists of a
replication-deficient chimpanzee adenoviral vector
ChAdOx1, containing the SARS-CoV-2 structural surface
glycoprotein antigen (spike protein; nCoV-19) gene.
Following initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial in the UK
(COV001) on April 23, 2020, three further randomised
controlled trials of the candidate vaccine were initiated
across the UK (COV002), Brazil (COV003), and South
Africa (COV005). A further phase 1/2 trial has recently
been initiated in Kenya and is not reported here. The
immunogenicity results from the phase 1/2 UK study,
COV001, in 1077 healthy adults aged 18–55 years,5 and a

Added value of this study
We report on the first clinical efficacy results of ChAdOx1
nCoV-19 in a pooled analysis of phase 2/3 trials in the UK and
Brazil, and safety data from more than 20 000 participants
enrolled across four clinical trials in the UK, Brazil, and
South Africa. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has an acceptable safety
profile and is efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19,
with no hospital admissions or severe cases reported in the
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 arm. The vaccine can be stored and
distributed at 2–8°C, making it particularly suitable for global
distribution.
Implications of all the available evidence
The development of safe, effective, affordable, and deployable
vaccines against COVID-19 remains paramount in solving the
pandemic crisis and re-establishing normality. The positive
results presented here support regulatory submissions for
conditional or emergency use of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.

phase 2 cohort in COV002 in older adults (≥56 years)6
have been published and show an acceptable safety profile
for the vaccine with induction of binding and neutralising
antibodies as well as generation of interferon-γ enzymelinked immunospot responses, with higher antibody titres
after a second dose of vaccine.5–7
The phase 1 study (COV001) included an efficacy cohort
and the phase 2 and 3 studies (COV002, COV003, and
COV005) expanded enrolment to a wider population of
participants with higher likelihood of exposure to the
virus, such as health-care workers. Exclusion criteria were
reduced for phase 3 trials, so that older adults and
individuals with a range of comorbidities were also
enrolled.
All studies have completed enrolment of their
respective efficacy cohorts and are in the follow-up phase.
Paediatric studies have not yet been initiated.
Here, we present the combined interim analysis of
efficacy and safety from randomised controlled trials of
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.

Methods
Overview

This interim analysis of the efficacy and safety of
the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine includes data from
four ongoing blinded, randomised, controlled trials done
across three countries: COV001 (phase 1/2; UK), COV002
(phase 2/3; UK), COV003 (phase 3; Brazil), and COV005
(phase 1/2; South Africa). The interim efficacy is
being assessed by a prespecified global pooled analysis
combining data from COV002 and COV003. The safety of
the vaccine is being assessed using data from all
four studies (appendix 1 pp 3–4). Three of the studies
are single blind and one is double blind (COV005).
Primary efficacy was assessed in participants who received

two doses of the vaccine. All four studies included
participants who received two doses, with a booster dose
incorporated into the three trials6 that were initially
designed to assess a single-dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19
compared with control (COV001, COV002, and COV003)
after review of the antibody response data from COV001.
Despite minor differences across the studies, there is
sufficient consistency to justify the proposal for pooled
analysis of data, which will provide greater precision
for both efficacy and safety outcomes than can be
achieved in individual studies and provides a broader
understanding of the use of the vaccine in different
populations. Once the studies were underway, a statistical
analysis plan for the global pooled analysis of these
studies was developed before data lock on Nov 4, 2020,
and analysis, and was finalised with extensive feedback
from national and international regulators (including
the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory
Agency [UK] and the European Medicines Agency [EU]),
including justification for including groups receiving
different vaccine doses in the analysis (see statistical
analysis plan for further details; appendix 2 pp 2–73). All
participants in the four trials provided written informed
consent.
Details of amendments to the four trial protocols and
the statistical analysis plan are included in appendix 2
(pp 9, 178–182, 327–335, 438–441, 548–550).

Study design and participants
COV001 (UK)
COV001 is a continuing single-blind phase 1/2 clinical
trial in five sites in the UK, which began on April 23, 2020,
and enrolled 1077 healthy volunteers aged 18–55 years, as
previously described.5 Briefly, healthy adult participants
were enrolled after screening to exclude those with
pre-existing health conditions. Participants were ran­
domly assigned 1:1 to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose
of 5 × 10¹⁰ viral particles (standard dose), mea­sured using
spectropho­
tometry, or meningococcal group A, C, W,
and Y conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. An
open-label non-randomised subgroup of ten participants
were given two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 28 days apart,
as previously reported.5 This study was originally planned
as a single-dose study and 88 participants in the phase 1
part of the study remain recipients of a single dose.
However, the protocol was modified to a two-dose regime,
following an amendment on July 30, 2020 (version 9.0;
appendix 2 pp 180–181), for the remaining phase 2
cohorts as a result of robust booster responses identified
in the evaluation of the early immunogenicity cohorts,
with the booster dose given at the earliest possible time.5

COV002 (UK)
COV002 is a continuing single-blind phase 2/3 study
in the UK that began on May 28, 2020, and enrolled
participants in 19 study sites in England, Wales, and
Scotland. Enrolment particularly targeted individuals

working in profes­sions with high possible exposure to
SARS-CoV-2, such as health and social care settings.
Two dosage groups were included in COV002:
participants who received a low dose of the vaccine
(2·2 × 10¹⁰ viral particles) as their first dose and were
boosted with a standard dose (in the LD/SD group),
and subse­
quent cohorts who were vaccinated with
two standard-dose vaccines (SD/SD group). Initial dosing
in COV002 was with a batch manufactured at a contract
manufacturing organisation using chromatographic
purification. During quality control of this second batch,
differences were observed between the quantification
methods (spectrophotometry and quantitative PCR
[qPCR]) prioritised by different manufacturing sites. In
consultation with the national regulator (Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), we selected
a dose of 5 × 10¹⁰ viral particles by spectrophotometer
(2·2 × 10¹⁰ viral particles by qPCR), in order to be
consistent with the use of spectrophotometry in the
phase 1 study (COV001),5 and to ensure the dose was
within a safe and immunogenic range according to
measurements by both methods. A lower-than-antici­
pated reactogenicity profile was noted in the trial, and
unexpected interference of an excipient with the spec­
trophotometry assay was identified. After review and
approval by the regulator, it was concluded that the
qPCR (low-dose) reading was more accurate and further
doses were adjusted to the standard dose (5 × 10¹⁰ viral
particles) using a qPCR assay. The protocol was amended
on June 5, 2020, resulting in enrolment of two distinct
groups with different dosing regimens with no pause
in enrolment (version 6.0; appendix 2 p 330). A suite of
assays has now been developed for characterisation of
concentration (which confirmed the low and standard
dosing), and future batches are all released with a
specification dose of 3·5–6·5 × 10¹⁰ viral particles, and
this was used for the booster doses in the efficacy analysis
presented here.
The LD/SD cohort (aged 18–55 years) was enrolled
over 11 days between May 31 and June 10, 2020. The
SD/SD cohort (aged 18–55 years) was enrolled from
June 9 to July 20, 2020. Subsequently, enrolment of older
age cohorts began (from Aug 8, 2020, for participants
aged 56–69 years and from Aug 13, 2020, for partici­
pants aged ≥70 years), all of whom were assigned to
two standard doses (SD/SD cohort). Each site imple­
mented the protocol amendment before changing
from low-dose administration to standard-dose admin­
istration, and therefore there was no overlap in enrolment
of participants in these cohorts.
The 18–55-year-old cohorts were originally planned as
single-dose efficacy cohorts. However, the protocol was
modified on July 20, 2020, to offer a second dose to
the participants in these cohorts as a result of robust
booster responses identified in the evaluation of the
early immunogenicity cohorts (version 9.0; appendix 2
pp 331–332).5 Boosting began on Aug 3, 2020, resulting

in a longer gap between prime and booster vaccines in
these cohorts than for those aged 55–69 years and those
aged 70 years or older, as these participants were enrolled
into two-dose groups from the start.
Results for participants enrolled into immunogenicity
subgroups have been previously published, including a
small subset who received a low-dose boost.6 Full details
are available in the study protocol (appendix 2 pp 184–342)
and the procedures have been previously described.6

used for the study electronic case report form (REDCap
version 9.5.22) for COV001, COV002, and COV003. In
COV005, the randomisation list was held by the unmasked
study pharmacist who prepared the vaccines for admin­
istration, with all other trial staff masked to group
allocation. The trial staff administering the vaccine pre­
pared vaccines out of sight of the par­ticipants and syringes
were covered with an opaque material until ready for
administration to ensure masking of participants.

COV003 (Brazil)

Procedures

COV003 is a continuing single-blind phase 3 study in
Brazil that began on June 23, 2020. The focus of recruit­
ment was targeted at those at high risk of exposure to the
virus, including health-care workers at six sites across
Brazil. Participants were aged 18 years or older, and this
trial included individuals with stable pre-existing health
conditions. All participants were offered two doses of
the vaccine at a dose of 3·5–6·5 × 10¹⁰ viral particles with
administration up to 12 weeks apart (target 4 weeks),
following a protocol amendment on July 28, 2020, to
include booster groups (version 4.0; appendix 2
pp 438–439). Full details are available in the study
protocol (appendix 2 pp 343–441).

The recombinant adenovirus for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was
manufactured and vialed by Advent (Pomezia, Italy), and
additional batches produced by COBRA Biologics (Keele,
UK) and vialed by Symbiosis (Sterling, UK). Both were
manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice
and approved by the regulatory agency in the UK, the
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.
Baseline assessments included review of inclusion
and exclusion criteria, medical history, vital signs mea­
sure­
ment, history-directed clinical examination, and
collection of serum for SARS-CoV-2 serology.
Participants across all four trials were asked to contact
the study site if they experienced specific symptoms
associated with COVID-19 and received regular
reminders to do so. Those who met symp­tomatic criteria
had a clinical assessment, a swab taken for a nucleic acid
amplification test (NAAT), and blood samples taken for
safety and immunogenicity. In the UK and Brazil, the
list of qualifying symptoms for swabbing included any
one of the following: fever of at least 37·8°C, cough,
shortness of breath, and anosmia or ageusia. In South
Africa, the list of qualifying symptoms for swabbing was
broader, and additionally included myalgia, chills, sore
throat, headache, nasal congestion, diarrhoea, runny
nose, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite.
In all studies, if participants were tested outside of the
trial, either in their workplace if a health-care worker or
by private providers, these results were recorded and
assessed by a masked independent endpoint review
committee. The source of each swab was recorded plus
the details of the test kit where available.
To test for asymptomatic infections, participants in
COV002 in the UK were asked to provide a weekly selfadministered nose and throat swab for NAAT testing
from 1 week after first vaccination using kits provided by
the UK Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).
Participants were given home test kits provided by the
DHSC that included step-by-step instructions on how
to do a self-swab and a link to a demonstration video.
The site trial team provided support with logistics of
packaging and returning test kits and tracking swab
results to participants if required. Swabs were taken by
participants in their homes and posted to dedicated
DHSC testing laboratories for processing. Participants
were directly informed of their results by text or email
from the National Health Service (NHS). Swab results

COV005 (South Africa)
COV005 is a continuing double-blind phase 1/2 study in
South Africa in healthy adults aged 18–65 years living
without HIV that began on June 28, 2020. An additional
immunogenicity cohort of those living with HIV was also
enrolled but are not included in this interim analysis.
All participants were offered two doses of the vaccine at
a dose of 3·5–6·5 × 10¹⁰ viral particles, with doses admin­
istered 4 weeks apart. A small subgroup of 44 participants
received a half-dose vaccine (21 as their first dose and
23 as their second dose) as a result of variability in the
release assay, before the adoption of new methods for
characterisation of concentration. Adjustment in dose
was discussed with and approved by the national
regulator. Full details are available in the study protocol
(appendix 2 pp 442–559).
A combined independent data safety monitoring board
reviews safety data from all four trials on a regular basis.

Randomisation and masking
In efficacy cohorts for all studies, participants were
randomised 1:1 to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a control
product. In COV002, MenACWY was chosen as the
control group vaccine to minimise the chance of acci­
dental participant unmasking due to local or systemic
reactions to the vaccine. COV003 used MenACWY as the
control for the first dose and saline for the second dose. In
COV005, participants randomly assigned to the control

from participants in England and Wales were provided to
the trial statistician on a daily basis by the NHS and
matched to individuals based on personal identification
data (name, date of birth, NHS number, and postcode).
Swab results from participants in Scotland were
unavailable to the study team at the time of the data
cutoff for this analysis, but will be included in future
analyses. Any swab results that were not able to be
matched to a study participant using at least two pieces of
personal data were not added to the study database.
In Brazil, there was no testing plan for asymptomatic
infections. In South Africa, asymptomatic infections
were detected from swabs obtained at study visits
attended, but are not summarised here as there were
only a small number of timepoints for detection of these
cases.
All cases of COVID-19 were reviewed by two members
of a masked independent clinical review team who
assessed clinical details, including medical history,
symptoms, adverse events, and swab results, and
assigned severity scores according to the WHO clinical
progression scale.8
For symptomatic participants in COV002 in the UK,
weekly swabbing continued both before and after
participants reported symptoms to the study site. Thus, a
participant who reported symptoms and was clinically
assessed might also have had additional swabs return
positive results through the asymptomatic testing process
for several weeks. In addition, due to the large number of
health-care workers enrolled in these studies, some
participants were tested according to their workplace
testing policies and these results were also entered into
the database for review by the masked endpoint evaluation
committee. Further exploratory assessment of the length
of time participants remained NAAT-positive, and the
sources of information used for case detection will be
done in future analyses.

Outcomes
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against NAAT-confirmed
COVID-19. The primary outcome was virologically
confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19, defined as a NAATpositive swab combined with at least one qualifying
symptom (fever ≥37·8°C, cough, shortness of breath, or
anosmia or ageusia).
All participants were given an emergency 24-h telephone
number to contact the on-call study physician for the
duration of the study to report any illnesses. Serious
adverse events were recorded throughout the study and
reviewed at each study visit, with causality assigned by the
site investigator. Events were clinically coded according to
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.

Statistical analysis
The plan for assessing efficacy and safety for the ChAdOx1
nCoV-19 vaccine is based on global analyses using all
www.thelancet.com Vol 397 January 9, 2021

available data from four studies with analysis pooled
across the studies. A global statistical analysis plan for
pooling study data was developed, after extensive advice
from regulators, to prespecify the analyses that would
contribute to the assessment of efficacy and this was
signed off before any data analysis was conducted.
Randomised participants who received at least one
dose in all studies are included in the safety analysis.
However, each study had to meet prespecified criteria of
having at least five cases eligible for inclusion in the
primary outcome before a study was included in efficacy
analyses. Neither COV001 or COV005 met these criteria
and so are not included in the efficacy assessment for
this interim analysis. It is expected that they will be
included in efficacy assessments in future analyses
once more cases have accrued. Additionally, only efficacy
groups for COV002 (ie, groups 4, 6, 9, and 10) were
included.
Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 – adjusted relative
risk (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vs control groups) computed
using a Poisson regression model with robust variance.9
The model contained terms for study, treatment group,
and age group (18–55, 56–69, and ≥70 years) at ran­
domisation. A reduced model that did not contain a term
for age was used for models affected by convergence
issues due to having few cases in the older age groups.
The logarithm of the period at risk for the primary
endpoint for pooled analysis was used as an offset
variable in the model to adjust for volunteers having
different follow-up times during which the events
occurred. Cumulative incidence is presented using the
Kaplan-Meier method.
The global pooled analysis plan allowed for an interim
and a final efficacy analysis with α adjusted between
the two analyses using a flexible gamma α-spending
function, with significance being declared if the lower
bound of the (1 − α)% CI is greater than 20%. Evidence
of efficacy at the time of the interim analysis was not
considered reason to stop the trials and all trials are
continuing to accrue further data that will be included in
future analyses.
The first interim analysis was planned to be triggered
when at least 53 cases in participants who had received
two standard-dose vaccines (SD/SD) had accrued that
met the primary outcome definition more than 14 days
after the second dose. This analysis provides 77% power
for the 20% threshold to assume a true vaccine efficacy
of 70%. Although the number of cases in the SD/SD
cohort was used as the trigger for the interim analysis,
the pre­specified primary analysis included both SD/SD
and LD/SD recipients. Due to the rapid increase in
incidence of COVID-19 in the UK in October, more than
53 cases had accrued by the time of data lock for this
interim analysis. There were 98 cases available for
inclusion in the SD/SD cohorts. Based on these numbers,
the α level calculated using the gamma α-spending
function for this analysis is 4·16%.

Participants were excluded from the primary efficacy
analysis if they were seropositive at baseline or had no
baseline result. Other exclusions included those with
NAAT-positive swabs within 14 days after the second
vaccination, or those who discontinued from the study
before having met the primary efficacy endpoint with a
follow-up time of less than 15 days after the second
vaccination. All reasons for exclusion are shown in
appendix 1 (pp 5–8).
An analysis of efficacy after the first standard-dose
vaccine in those who only received standard-dose vaccines
was undertaken as a secondary analysis. Individuals were
excluded if they had a NAAT-positive swab within 21 days
after their first standard-dose vaccine.
Participants were analysed according to the vaccines
they received. Sensitivity analyses included those who
were seropositive at baseline and an intention-to-treat
analysis. Safety analyses include all randomised partici­
pants who received at least one dose of any vaccine in any
study.
Prespecified subgroup analyses are not included in this
report but will be presented in future analyses when
a larger dataset is available. However, in response to
reviewer and editorial comments, a small number of
exploratory subgroup comparisons has been included to
explore differences in efficacy in the LD/SD and SD/SD

groups and potential confounder variables. The LD/SD
cohort in the UK comprised participants aged 18–55 years
who received their second dose after a substantial gap.
Age and the time difference between vaccines were
therefore potential confounders and were explored
further in subgroup analyses, restricted to those aged
18–55 years, those with more than 8 weeks’ interval
between vaccine doses, and a comparison of those in the
SD/SD cohort receiving vaccines at short (<6 weeks)
or long (≥6 weeks) intervals. Subgroup comparisons
were done by incor­porating the treatment-by-subgroup
interaction term in the model and reporting the p value
for the interaction term.
Data analysis was done using R (version 3.6.1 or later).
Robust Poisson models were fitted using the PROC
GENMOD function in SAS (version 9.4). The α level for
the analysis was calculated using the gsDesign function
in R. The cutoff date for inclusion in the analysis was
Nov 4, 2020, and the data lock date was Nov 21, 2020.
The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424
(COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001),
NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005).

Vaccine efficacy was calculated from the robust Poisson model. The primary efficacy population (LD/SD and SD/SD) includes randomly assigned participants who were
seronegative at baseline and received LD/SD or SD/SD or were in a corresponding control group, and remained on study more than 14 days after their second dose without
having had a previous virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, for groups in COV002, only efficacy groups (ie, groups 4, 6, 9, and 10) are included.
SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. LD/SD=low-dose prime plus standard-dose boost. SD/SD=two standard-dose vaccines given. NAAT=nucleic acid
amplification test. *CIs are 95% unless indicated otherwise. †95·8% CI used for primary analysis. ‡Vaccine efficacy calculated from a reduced robust Poisson model that was not
adjusted for age. All other models included an adjustment for age. §p value for interaction term comparing LD/SD with SD/SD is p=0·010. ¶Other non-primary symptomatic
COVID-19 disease includes cases who have symptoms other than the five main symptoms that are required for inclusion in the primary analysis (eg, a participant who has
diarrhoea and malaise but no fever, cough, shortness of breath, anosmia, or ageusia).

Results
Between April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23 848 participants
were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies:
1077 in COV001 (UK), 10 673 in COV002 (UK), 10 002 in
COV003 (Brazil), and 2096 in COV005 (South Africa).
11 636 participants in COV002 and COV003 met the
inclusion criteria for the primary analysis, 5807 of whom
received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 5829 of
whom received two doses of control product. A trial
profile and reasons for exclusion from the primary
analysis are shown in appendix 1 (pp 5–7). Here, we
provide safety data on 74 341 person-months of follow-up
after first dose (median 3·4 months, IQR 1·3–4·8) and
29 060 person-months of follow-up after two doses
(median 2·0, 1·3–2·3).
Of the participants in COV002 and COV003 included
in the primary efficacy analyses, the majority were
www.thelancet.com Vol 397 January 9, 2021

aged 18–55 years (6542 [86·7%] of 7548 in the UK
and 3676 [89·9%] of 4088 in Brazil; table 1). Those aged
56 years or older were recruited later and contributed
12·2% of the total cohort in the current analysis
(1006 [13·3%] in the UK and 412 [10·1%] in Brazil).
7045 (60·5%) participants were female. 6902 (91·4%)
participants in the UK and 2723 (66·6%) participants in
Brazil were white (table 1). Baseline participants of the
safety population are shown in appendix 1 (pp 9–10).
The timing of priming and booster vaccine admin­
istration varied between studies. As protocol amendments
to add a booster dose took place when the trials were
underway, and owing to the time taken to manufacture
and release a new batch of vaccine, doses could not
be administered at a 4-week interval. 1459 (53·2%) of
2741 participants in COV002 in the LD/SD group received
a second dose at least 12 weeks after the first (median
84 days, IQR 77—91) and only 22 (0·8%) received a second
dose within 8 weeks of the first. The median interval
between doses for the SD/SD group in COV002 was
69 days (50–86). Conversely, the majority of participants
in COV003 in the SD/SD group (2493 [61·0%] of 4088)
received a second dose within 6 weeks of the first (median
36 days, 32–58; appendix 1 p 11).

A small proportion of participants were seropositive
at baseline (138 [1·3%] of 10 673 in the UK and 235 [2·3%]
of 10 002 in Brazil). Three participants seropositive at
baseline had subse­quent NAAT-positive swabs. One par­
ticipant had an asymptomatic infection 3 weeks after a
first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Two other participants in
the control group had symptomatic infections 8 weeks
and 21 weeks after their baseline sample was taken.
There were 131 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 in
LD/SD or SD/SD recipients who were eligible for
inclusion in the primary efficacy analysis more than
14 days after the second dose of vaccine (table 2). There

were 30 (0·5%) cases among 5807 participants in the
vaccine arm and 101 (1·7%) cases among 5829 par­
ticipants in the control group, resulting in vaccine
efficacy of 70·4% (95·8% CI 54·8–80·6; table 2; figure).
In participants who received two standard-dose vaccines,
vaccine efficacy was 62·1% (95% CI 41·0–75·7), whereas
in those who received a low dose as their first dose of
vaccine, efficacy was higher at 90·0% (67·4–97·0;
pinteraction=0·010; table 2; appendix 1 pp 12–13).
In England and Wales, 129 529 weekly self-swabs
were processed by the DHSC, of which 126 324 (97·5%)
were matched to study participants. There were
435 positive swabs, of which 354 (81·4%) were matched.
Symptoms in these participants were not routinely
assessed as swabs were done at home and sent for testing
through the post. Asymptomatic infections or those with
unreported symptoms were detected in 69 participants
(table 2). Vaccine efficacy in the 24 LD/SD recipients was
58·9% (95% CI 1·0 to 82·9), whereas it was 3·8%
(−72·4 to 46·3) in the 45 participants receiving SD/SD
(table 2).
Results from sensitivity analyses, including partici­
pants who were seropositive at baseline and by intention
to treat, were very similar to main results (data not
shown).
Results from the subgroup comparisons presented in
this analysis were similar to overall results (table 3). In
the SD/SD UK cohort who were aged 18–55 years,
49 cases were available for inclusion in the analysis
and vaccine efficacy was 59·3% (95% CI 25·1 to 77·9;
pinteraction=0·019; table 3). When further restricted to those
who received their vaccines more than 8 weeks apart,
33 cases were included in the SD/SD analysis and
vaccine efficacy was 65·6% (24·5 to 84·4; pinteraction=0·082;
table 3; appendix 1 pp 12–13). In the SD/SD cohorts in
the UK and Brazil, vaccine efficacy was similar when
analysed in subgroups according to time between

Vaccine efficacy was calculated from the robust Poisson model. The first-standard-dose efficacy population includes participants seronegative at baseline who received only standard dose vaccines or were in the
corresponding control group, and remained on study 22 days after their first dose without having had a previous virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, for groups in COV002, only efficacy
groups (ie, groups 4, 6, 9, and 10) are included. SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. NAAT=nucleic acid amplification test. *NAAT-positive swab plus at least one of cough, shortness of
breath, fever higher than 37·8°C, anosmia, or ageusia. †Other non-primary symptomatic COVID-19 disease includes cases that have symptoms other than the five main symptoms required for inclusion in the
primary analysis (eg, a participant who has diarrhoea and malaise but no fever, cough, shortness of breath, anosmia, or ageusia). ‡Vaccine efficacy was calculated from a reduced robust Poisson model (excluding
the age group category due to the full model failing to converge). Participants with a low-dose prime were excluded.
Table 4: Efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 more than 21 days after the first standard dose in seronegative participants who received only standard doses

vaccines, at 53·4% (−2·5 to 78·8) in participants
with less than 6 weeks’ interval between doses and
65·4% (41·1 to 79·6) in participants with at least 6 weeks’
interval (pinteraction=0·56; table 3).
For our secondary analysis of cases occurring more
than 21 days after the first standard dose in partici­
pants who received only standard doses, there were
192 included cases with a vaccine efficacy of 64·1%
(95% CI 50·5–73·9; table 4; figure)
More than 21 days after their first dose, ten participants
were hospitalised due to COVID-19 (defined as WHO
clinical progression score ≥4), two of whom were
assessed as having severe COVID-19 (WHO score ≥6),
including one fatal case. All ten cases were in the control
group (table 5).
Five cases included in the primary analysis occurred in
those participants older than 55 years of age. Vaccine
efficacy in older age groups could not be assessed but will
be determined, if sufficient data are available, in a future
analysis after more cases have accrued.
Across all four studies, the vaccine had a good safety
profile with serious adverse events and adverse events of
special interest balanced across the study arms. Serious
adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 79 of whom
received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 89 of whom received
MenACWY or saline control (appendix 1 pp 15–18).
There were 175 events (84 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19
group and 91 in the control group), three of which were
considered possibly related to either the experimental or
a control vaccine. A case of haemolytic anaemia in the
control group in the UK phase 1/2 study occurring
10 days after MenACWY vaccine was considered possibly
related to the intervention and has been previously
described.5 A case of transverse myelitis was reported

The safety population includes all randomisation participants who received at
least one dose of vaccine. Severe COVID-19 (WHO score ≥6) is a subset of
hospitalisations (WHO score ≥4). Cases were eligible for inclusion in efficacy if the
first symptom or first NAAT-positive result was on or before the data cutoff date
(Nov 4, 2020). Two cases appear in this table that do not appear in the table for
serious adverse events in appendix 1 (pp 15–20) as the adverse event reporting
date was after the data cutoff date. MenACWY=meningococcal group A, C, W,
and Y conjugate vaccine. NAAT=nucleic acid amplification test. *One case on the
day of the first vaccination and one case 10 days after the first dose.

rapidly without an alternative diagnosis and was not
admitted to hospital. The participant remains masked to
group allocation, continues in the trial, and received a
second dose of the allocated vaccine without a similar
reaction.
There were two additional cases of transverse myelitis
that were originally reported as potentially related but
later determined to be unlikely to be related to vaccination
by an independent committee of neurological experts.
One case that occurred 10 days after a first vaccination
with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was initially assessed as possibly
related, but later considered unlikely to be related by the
site investigator when further investigation revealed preexisting, but previously unrecognised, multiple sclerosis.
The second case was reported 68 days after MenACWY
vaccination. While considered possibly related by the site
investigator at the time of reporting, an independent
panel of neurological experts considered this to be
unlikely. All trial participants have recovered, or are in a
stable or improving condition.
There were four non-COVID-19 deaths reported across
the studies (three in the control arm and one in the
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 arm) that were all considered
unrelated to the vaccine, with cause of death assessed as
road traffic accident, blunt force trauma, homicide, and
fungal pneumonia.

Discussion
Here, we present the first interim safety and efficacy
data for a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1
nCoV-19, evaluated in four trials across three continents,
showing significant vaccine efficacy of 70·4% after
two doses and protection of 64·1% after at least one
standard dose, against symptomatic disease, with no
safety concerns.
The prespecified analysis population, which was
determined following feedback from national and
international regulators before unblinding of the study,
included a pooled analysis from several countries to
improve generalisability, and inclusion of two dose
subgroups within the UK trial. This pooling strategy was
authorised by the chief investigator (AJP) and study
statistician (MV), with no concerns about pooling
different control groups, and was accepted by regulators
involved in the discussions. There had been initial
concern that the LD/SD regimen might have lower
efficacy than SD/SD, and the regulatory authority
acceptance of the inclusion of the two trial regimens
(LD/SD and SD/SD) in analysis was based on the
observation that these regimens generated similar levels
of binding antibody, and would therefore increase the
sample size available for analysis without compromising
efficacy. The discussion about pooling and inclusion of
LD/SD was made at a time when disease rates were low
in the UK and, in the face of the pandemic, it was agreed
that pooling could provide the earliest possible read on
efficacy that could contribute to public health.
108

No previous trials have been published on the efficacy
of a viral-vectored coronavirus vaccine and so this study
provides the first peer-reviewed evidence that induction
of immune responses against spike protein using viral
vectors provides protection against the disease in
humans, as has been seen in animal models.
In participants who received two standard doses,
efficacy against primary symptomatic COVID-19 was
consistent in both the UK (60·3% efficacy) and Brazil
(64·2% efficacy), indicating these results are generalisable
across two diverse settings with different timings for the
booster dose (with most participants in the UK receiving
the booster dose more than 12 weeks after the first dose
and most participants in Brazil receiving their second
dose within 6 weeks of the first). Exploratory subgroup
analyses included at the request of reviewers and editors
also showed no significant difference in efficacy esti­
mates when com­
paring those with a short time
window between doses (<6 weeks) and those with longer
(≥6 weeks), although further detailed exploration of the
timing of doses might be warranted.
Efficacy of 90·0% seen in those who received a low
dose as prime in the UK was intriguingly high compared
with the other findings in the study. Although there is
a possibility that chance might play a part in such
divergent results, a similar contrast in efficacy between
the LD/SD and SD/SD recipients with asymptomatic
infections provides support for the observation (58·9%
[95% CI 1·0 to 82·9] vs 3·8% [−72·4 to 46·3]). Explora­
tory sub­
group analyses, included at the request of
reviewers and editors, that were restricted to participants
aged 18–55 years, or aligned (>8 weeks) intervals
between doses, showed similar findings. Use of a low
dose for priming could provide substantially more
vaccine for distribution at a time of constrained supply,
and these data imply that this would not compromise
protection. While a vaccine that could prevent COVID-19
would have a substantial public health benefit, pre­
vention of asymptomatic infection could reduce viral
transmission and protect those with underlying health
conditions who do not respond to vaccination, those
who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons, and those
who will not or cannot access a vaccine, providing wider
benefit for society. However, the wide CIs around our
estimates show that further data are needed to confirm
these preliminary findings, which will be done in future
analyses of the data accruing in these ongoing trials.
Similar results have been seen for other vaccines where
a reduced number or type of priming dose in infancy can
lead to higher responses to a booster vaccine.10 Further
work is needed to determine the mechanism of the
increased efficacy with a LD/SD regimen, which might
be due to higher levels of neutralising antibody, lower
levels of anti-vector immunity with lower vector-derived
antigen content of the first dose, or differential antibody
functionality or cellular immunity, including altered
avidity or immunodominance.

Other coronavirus vaccine developers have released
preliminary high-level results in public statements,
including more than 90% efficacy reported for the lipid
nanoparticle mRNA vaccine BNT162b2,11 92% efficacy
for the Sputnik V vaccine (developed at the National
Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology),12
and 94·5% for the Moderna lipid nanoparticle
mRNA-1273 vaccine.13 The possibility that more than one
efficacious vaccine against COVID-19 might be approved
for use in the near future is encouraging. However,
control of pandemic coronavirus will only be achieved if
the licensure, manufacturing, and distribution of these
vaccines can be achieved at an unprecedented scale and
vaccination is rolled out to all those who are vulnerable.
The US Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines
indicate that they would license a vaccine against the
pandemic virus that showed at least 50% efficacy14 and
WHO have indicated a minimum efficacy of 50% in its
target product profile.15 A modelling study found that a
vaccine with efficacy of 60–80% could allow reduction in
physical distancing measures, but this would still require
high coverage.16 The findings here indicate that the
efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 exceeds these thresholds
and has the potential to have a public health impact.
Much consideration has been given to the statistical
confidence in vaccine efficacy estimates, given the size
of the global population who might be vaccinated. To
ensure that point estimates of efficacy in clinical trials
are sufficiently robust, some regulatory authorities
consider that the lower bound of the CI for efficacy
should be higher than 20% (personal communication),
with other authorities more stringent and anticipating a
lower bound of 30% for licensure.14 Here, we present data
that exceed both these thresholds in the pooled analysis,
which we had agreed with regulators before unblinding
of the study, and also meet the thresholds set in the
individual analyses of trials by country and by study arm.
We designed our studies early in the pandemic and
fixed our primary symptomatic disease endpoint on the
basis of expert analysis and guidelines from Public
Health England and WHO as the first wave of disease
spread around the world, although these have now been
substantially updated.17,18 We have used a restricted
definition of symptomatic disease, since many other
symptoms that are associated with COVID-19 disease are
non-specific. Since endpoints in protocols for different
vaccines are not well aligned, we recognise that it will
be difficult to compare efficacy across programmes.
However, we have also included hospital admissions and
severe disease as an endpoint in the current study, which
might be easier to assess in comparison with other
vaccines, and found that in the ten cases available
for analysis more than 21 days after the first dose, there
was complete protection against hospitali­
sation for
COVID-19.
While the data presented here show that ChAdOx1
nCov-19 is efficacious against symptomatic disease, with
www.thelancet.com Vol 397 January 9, 2021

most cases accruing in adults younger than 55 years of age
so far, an important public health consideration is the
morbidity and mortality of the disease in an older adult
population and thus the potential efficacy in this age
group. We have reported immunogenicity data showing
similar immune responses following vaccination with two
doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 in older adults, including those
older than 70 years of age, when compared with those
younger than 55 years.6 As older age groups were recruited
later than younger age groups, there has been less time for
cases to accrue and as a result, efficacy data in these cohorts
are currently limited by the small number of cases, but
additional data will be available in future analyses.
These trials, conducted on three different continents,
enrolled geographically and ethnically diverse popula­
tions. Severe COVID-19 has been seen to dispropor­
tionately affect people of non-white ethnicity, as well as
those who are male, overweight, and the elderly.19,20
In our studies, the demographic characteristics of those
enrolled varied between countries. In the UK, the enrolled
population was predominantly white and, in younger age
groups, included more female participants due to the
focus on enrolment of health-care workers. This is a
typically lower risk population for severe COVID-19. The
demographic profile combined with the weekly selfswabbing for asymptomatic infection in the UK results in
a milder case-severity profile. In Brazil, there was a larger
proportion of non-white ethnicities, and again the majority
of those enrolled were health-care workers.
We have previously reported on the local and systemic
reactogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and shown that it
is tolerated and that the side-effects are less both in
intensity and number in older adults, with lower doses,
and after the second dose. Although there were many
serious adverse events reported in the study in view of
the size and health status of the population included,
there was no pattern of these events that provided a safety
signal in the study. Three cases of transverse myelitis
were initially reported as suspected unexpected serious
adverse reactions, with two in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19
vaccine study arm, triggering a study pause for careful
review in each case. Independent clinical review of these
cases has indicated that one in the experimental group
and one in the control group are unlikely to be related to
study interventions, but a relationship remained possible
in the third case. Careful monitoring of safety, including
neurological events, continues in the trials. All safety
data will be provided to regulators for review.
In this interim analysis, we have not been able to
assess duration of protection, since the first trials were
initiated in April, 2020, such that all disease episodes
have accrued within 6 months of the first dose being
administered. Further evidence will be required to
determine duration of protection and the need for
additional booster doses of vaccine.
The results presented in this Article constitute the key
findings from the first interim analysis, which are

provided for rapid review by the public and policy makers.
In future analyses with additional data included as they
accrue, we will investigate differences in key subgroups
such as older cohorts, ethnicity, dose regimen, and timing
of booster vaccines, and we will search for correlates of
protection.
Until widespread immunity halts the spread of
SARS-CoV-2, physical distancing measures and novel
therapies are needed to control COVID-19. In the
meantime, an efficacious vaccine has the potential to
have a major impact on the pandemic if used in
populations at risk of severe disease. Here, we have
shown for the first time that a viral vector vaccine,
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, is efficacious and could contribute to
control of the disease in this pandemic.
